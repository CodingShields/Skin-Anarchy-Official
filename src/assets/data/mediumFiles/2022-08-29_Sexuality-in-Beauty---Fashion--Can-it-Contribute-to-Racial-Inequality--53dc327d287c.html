It is difficult not to notice the “lines” of femineity and masculinity vastly dissipating from social beauty standards. However, I can’t help but wonder if many creators are breaking these lines for generational change or trendsetting culture. For example, there was such a craze when Harry Styles wore a dress for a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vogue</em> cover shoot in 2020, and although he looked terrific, it was not something “innovative” (at least to me). Billy Porter is one of the most influential male celebrities that, I believe, genuinely break the lines of masculinity not only because of fashion but to show that clothing should have no gender preference.</p><p name="c2e1" id="c2e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what is the difference between someone of Styles’ caliber wearing a dress for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vouge</em> versus Porter wearing a ball gown for the Oscars? It may seem hard for some to hear this, but it is because this conversation of gender and sexuality conformity in society goes far beyond Harry Styles. However, when Porter commented on the lack of true non-binary representation within fashion, many ridiculed him for “bashing” Styles on an issue that has “little to do with the space of the industry.” Yet, that idea is the unfortunate reality that many people, such as Porter, are desperately fighting to change for future generations.</p><p name="5450" id="5450" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Them Magazine</em> article, “Billy Porter Apologizes to Harry Styles Over <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vouge</em> Cover Criticism,” Joseph Longo dives into Porter’s apology to Styles. He also displays Portor’s view of the issue, showing the fashion industry’s disregard for the people of color who continuously contribute to beauty culture. “While appearing on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Late Show</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">with Stephen Colbert</em> last week, Porter apologized to the “Watermelon Sugar” singer over the criticism. “The first thing I want to say is, Harry Styles, I apologize to you for having your name in my mouth,” he said. “It is not about you. The conversation is not about you.” “The conversation is actually deeper than that,” Porter continued. “It is about the systems of oppression and erasure of people of color who contribute to the culture.” (Longo).</p><figure name="c275" id="c275" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KdaVBLI472gPzmMJjuSpbg.jpeg" data-width="630" data-height="420" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KdaVBLI472gPzmMJjuSpbg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo By <a href="https://apnews.com/" data-href="https://apnews.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AP</a> on <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/entertainment-news-men-in-frocks-will-the-perfect-dress-for-men-ever-exist/399971" data-href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/entertainment-news-men-in-frocks-will-the-perfect-dress-for-men-ever-exist/399971" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OutLookIndia</a></figcaption></figure><p name="51fb" id="51fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although I commend Porter for clearing up the issue at hand, there is something that I do not entirely agree with in his statement. Yes, the conversation of representation of people of color in the fashion and beauty industry goes far beyond Styles but only to an extent. The reason I say this is because the dynamic of the issue may be bigger than him. Still, those of Styles’ caliber has more influential power to challenge such matters from occurring because (if the answer wasn’t clear enough) he is a White male who has a place in several Eurocentrically dominated industries from music to fashion.</p><p name="a1e8" id="a1e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Styles is one of the first males in over a century to be on the cover of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vogue</em>, but not only that, he “attempts” to break gender barriers of fashion, which several people of color have done for years, especially within the LGBTQ community. Yet icons such as Billy Porter, Lil Nas X, Kid Cudi, Jaden Smith, Jonathan Van Ness, and many more were pushed aside for such a monumental occasion in fashion history for such a prominent and influential publication. The issue is more on the industry’s mindset, but it takes us, as consumers and contributors in the beauty space, to speak out on these issues for any real change to happen.</p><p name="d876" id="d876" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all know that beauty and fashion have been catering to a specific group of people (mainly Europeans) for several generations. But there is this push for diversity, and many people of color step into areas of beauty that many of us never thought possible. But it is difficult to stay in these spaces and fight for our place when we are consistently put on the back burner for someone who fits the “standard.” It is 2022; what is the beauty standard in a constantly changing world? We should not discuss race in fashion and beauty when the most influential contributors are people of color and the LGBTQ community. Yet here we are in a generation that is defying and innovating societal norms discussing race and sexuality being disregarded in a culture that thrives through challenging conformity and promoting creativity and uniqueness.</p><figure name="4cbf" id="4cbf" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*f1WGllcAp4Hi6zmoDf95mw.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="797" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f1WGllcAp4Hi6zmoDf95mw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/c.syresmith/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/c.syresmith/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jaden Smith/ Instagram</a> on <a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/133923/what-our-obsession-with-jaden-smith-s-stunning-gender-fluid-photos-says-about-us" data-href="https://www.mic.com/articles/133923/what-our-obsession-with-jaden-smith-s-stunning-gender-fluid-photos-says-about-us" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MIC</a></figcaption></figure><p name="c3a0" id="c3a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As said previously, I believe that Billy Porter is one example of someone of our generation who pushes the boundaries of gender norms. But he is not afraid to stand up for underrepresented people in the beauty and fashion world, especially people of color and the LGBTQ community. Many people (Whites) may not understand the dynamics of the issue of representation because most of them do not need to fight to be seen. However, for someone such as Porter, he consistently must fight to be seen and respected as a creator and even within his gender. There was a time when we could not imagine a man wearing a ball gown to the Red Carpet, but Porter and several others have done it! But he is only one of the many past and present people who are opening doors for all of us in this industry.</p><p name="932a" id="932a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe that a large portion of the controversy displayed in this issue is the idea that “everything is or is not about race.” But it is about race and sexuality, and it always will be because that is the world we live in, and it is time for many of us to wake up from the idea that it may be the 21st century, but most days, it feels like 1935 and it is truly disheartening but not surprising. It takes only one person to put this issue out, and all this confrontational energy spurs into the mix because we are challenging the “norm.” However, just because something is “normal” does not mean it is right! If you feel this issue has nothing to do with race, you must wake up! If you think sexuality is not an issue anymore, then kindly pour some ice water on your face because you must be asleep!</p><p name="d4e1" id="d4e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are in an age of vast diversity and representation, but that does not mean that the fashion and beauty industry drastically change overnight. It is up to us, as the consumers of this community, to speak out against such inequalities. I am African American, Bi-sexual, and Female in American society, but I know I will never understand the depths of discrimination that people of color and those of the LGBTQ community have faced in the past. But that does not give me the right to exclude myself from the situation because it does not “involve me specifically.” Because by doing so, I would become part of the problem that faces several dynamics of American society today. But that is a larger issue for another time. So, do you think sexuality has a role in fashion and beauty? Are all people truly represented in this industry?</p><p name="8c05" id="8c05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me know your thoughts.</p><p name="f179" id="f179" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Author: Jasmine Boskent</p><p name="0e1c" id="0e1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Be sure to follow or social media channels below:</p><p name="7f83" id="7f83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</a></p><p name="7b6c" id="7b6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spotify Podcast: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</a></p><p name="f767" id="f767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</a></p><p name="c4e6" id="c4e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</a></p><p name="4bdf" id="4bdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" data-href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</a></p><p name="838b" id="838b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</a></p><p name="57f8" id="57f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</a></p><p name="89c1" id="89c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pinterest: <a href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" data-href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</a></p><p name="7747" id="7747" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</a></p><p name="1910" id="1910" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Works Cited</p><p name="42b2" id="42b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Longo, Joseph. “Billy Porter Apologizes to Harry Styles Over <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vouge</em> Cover Criticism”. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Them Magazine</em>. 9 Nov. 2021. <a href="https://www.them.us/story/billy-porter-apologizes-harry-styles-vogue-cover-criticism" data-href="https://www.them.us/story/billy-porter-apologizes-harry-styles-vogue-cover-criticism" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer noopener noopener" target="_blank">https://www.them.us/story/billy-porter-apologizes-harry-styles-vogue-cover-criticism</a>.
