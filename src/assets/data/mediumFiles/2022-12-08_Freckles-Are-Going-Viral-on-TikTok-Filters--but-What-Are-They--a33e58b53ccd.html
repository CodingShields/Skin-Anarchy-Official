Freckles were considered a flaw that had to be eliminated from the late 19th century until the early 20th century, which led to the invention of disappearing creams that were still being sold in the 1950s.</p><figure name="0bc4" id="0bc4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZsV2IQtDHE0RGvSxK8z2_Q.jpeg" data-width="700" data-height="874" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZsV2IQtDHE0RGvSxK8z2_Q.jpeg"></figure><p name="616d" id="616d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This change in mindset was apparently brought on by the dramatic lifestyle and fashion transition that occurred in the 1950s when a growing number of women preferred tanned skin, which was seen as a sign of ease and vitality. As a result, freckles were more relevant and accepted in the 1960s and continue to be so today.</p><p name="31f1" id="31f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to How Stuff Works, melanocytes are cells created expressly to shield our skin from the sun’s dangerous UV radiation. They achieve this by creating the chemical melanin, which darkens the skin to shield it from scorching and functions like sunglasses for the skin. These melanocytes are not spread equally across the bodies of individuals who have a fair or light complexion. This implies that freckling will happen spontaneously as our skin darkens. The MC1R gene, which regulates skin color, is a particular gene that freckle-faced people possess that our counterparts with even skin do not.</p><p name="f96b" id="f96b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A variation in the IRF4 gene linked to the development of brown hair, blue eyes, and — most significantly — freckles was discovered by 2,230 individuals in an Icelandic study. Daily Mail claims that RF4 has the effect of a “dimmer switch” and can lessen the amount of melanin that reaches keratinocytes, the skin’s surface cells. Skin freckling is caused by lower levels of melanin. Therefore, having this IRF4 variation gives you a genetic profile that is entirely different from that of other people and far more diverse. Additionally, no two freckles are alike. They are as distinctive as a snowflake. You alone are responsible for your freckles.</p><p name="2cae" id="2cae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Models with freckles are very popular. Both editors and designers are riding the freckle trend and making the most of it. Models with freckled faces dominate fashion campaigns and appear on every runway. Ultimately, beauty is shifting away from the commonplace and toward the unusual.</p><p name="41b2" id="41b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyone with freckles is innately passionately self-assured. We are not going to be afraid to be who we truly are because we know who we are. We are the most daring in the group and are not scared to stand out. Examples of freckled goddesses include Penélope Cruz, Mia Farrow, and Twiggy.</p><p name="80b0" id="80b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Freckled women already have enough going on with their faces without adding cosmetics. One can easily cover any passing pimples with concealer thanks to their two-toned skin, apply lip gloss, and carry on with their day. They can also exude natural beauty that doesn’t require any foundation or concealer. A woman with freckles boldly displays her skin. Everyone wants some freckles since they are fashionable.</p><p name="fd91" id="fd91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Currently, freckles are popular. Everyone wants to develop their own set of freckles. People who lack freckles desire to develop them. So that those without freckles can actually add freckles to their faces, Topshop is now selling a freckle pencil. Freckles are now painted on, as opposed to earlier being thought to be stylish to cover them up.</p><p name="c2bc" id="c2bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sources: <a href="https://www.image.ie/style/beauty/heres-freckles-winning-beauty-scene-right-now-111439" data-href="https://www.image.ie/style/beauty/heres-freckles-winning-beauty-scene-right-now-111439" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.image.ie/style/beauty/heres-freckles-winning-beauty-scene-right-now-111439</a></p><p name="cb19" id="cb19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.voirfashion.co.uk/post/2017-05-18-grains-of-beauty-why-freckles-are-spot-on/" data-href="https://www.voirfashion.co.uk/post/2017-05-18-grains-of-beauty-why-freckles-are-spot-on/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.voirfashion.co.uk/post/2017-05-18-grains-of-beauty-why-freckles-are-spot-on/</a></p><p name="a1c4" id="a1c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/freckles-scientifically-unique/988203" data-href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/freckles-scientifically-unique/988203" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/freckles-scientifically-unique/988203</a></p><p name="af76" id="af76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Written By: Yaren Ay</p><p name="b48f" id="b48f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PLEASE FOLLOW OUR SOCIALS:</p><p name="cddb" id="cddb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</a></p><p name="9fc3" id="9fc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spotify Podcast: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</a></p><p name="14bd" id="14bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</a></p><p name="5477" id="5477" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</a></p><p name="acca" id="acca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" data-href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</a></p><p name="efc4" id="efc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</a></p><p name="77c6" id="77c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</a></p><p name="f32b" id="f32b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pinterest: <a href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" data-href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</a></p><p name="9fbf" id="9fbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</a></p></div></div></section>
