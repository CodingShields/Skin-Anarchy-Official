Clark is not only a master makeup artist and aesthetician, but the founder of the skincare brand Beauty HAC. Clark, a third generation aesthetician, began her journey behind the Shiseido counter and now has her own aesthetician boutique, Blush Beauty Atelier, in San Francisco along with her brand. At Shiseido, Clark learned the importance of caring for your skin inside and out wth ancient Japanese health and beauty traditions such as lymphatic massage. While working for sephora.com, Clark birthed the now-popular term “beauty advisor” giving women across the country access to higher end cosmetic products and product education. During her time as a beauty director for Nordstrom, Clark closed the gap between styling and cosmetics by introducing a cosmetic personal shopping experience. From being the youngest beauty director at Nordstrom to being on the original team of sephora.com, Clark has been a trailblazer in her twenty year career in the skincare industry.</p><figure name="cd17" id="cd17" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*amPOvR6gJbIW2-D7HBglUw.png" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*amPOvR6gJbIW2-D7HBglUw.png"></figure></div></div></section><section name="776a" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="4cf1" id="4cf1" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf--leading graf--trailing"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/7zMM3Jt5rRJJHpP06GIlhe?utm_source=oembed" width="456" height="152" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure></div></div></section><section name="0f85" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1e98" id="1e98" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The concept of serving women is hugely important to Clark, explaining that she “found [Beauty HAC] as a woman sitting across from another woman helping her figure out what are her concerns … what goes on in her bathroom at 7am and how [she] can make a difference.” Beauty HAC came to market with only two products, however Clark explains the two products, an eye cream and neck cream, were carefully formulated to enhance an existing routine. Clark further explains that the goal of Beauty HAC is to “service women and honor her skincare ritual while still honoring the fact that she has things in her vanity she loves and wants to keep using.”</p><p name="ed6a" id="ed6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Author: Madigan Pizzella</p></div></div></section>
