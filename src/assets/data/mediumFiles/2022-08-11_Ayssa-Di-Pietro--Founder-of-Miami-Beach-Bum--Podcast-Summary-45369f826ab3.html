Ayssa’s journey began after she developed folliculitis from wearing a bathing suit and being in the ocean for lengthy periods. Due to this issue, her self-care routine soon became her worse nightmare. Though she tried several treatments, she could never find one that was not only effective but clean and environmentally friendly. So, she did her homework and used her background in green chemistry to birth the revolutionary line known today as Miami Beach Bum!</p><p name="20cf" id="20cf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Coming from a background in Marine Science and Engineering, I did not think starting a body care line is where my career would take me. But it all really started because I had these horrible folliculitis rashes, I would get on my bum for being in wet swimsuits for extended periods of time because for me self-care is all about getting back to nature and doing activities that you love. So, every day I am out paddle boarding, kite boarding, diving, or just swimming in the ocean and getting these folliculitis rashes from staying in a wet swimsuit the bacteria get trapped and they were giving me this bad bum breakout. As embarrassing or not embarrassing as it is I had horrible acne. This is really what broke me into the skincare industry and formulating my own skincare products.” (Di Pietro).</p><p name="487b" id="487b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ayssa cares about body care from her personal experience and puts the importance of body care at the forefront of the beauty industry. She understands that consumers care for the facial features of their skin, but the skin is everywhere, and every crevasse should have the same care as the face!</p><p name="fde6" id="fde6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Since I do not wear makeup or use hair products often and it seems like when it comes to your face the industry is on point there is something for everything, but back 2018 people really were not as focused on their body and body care and what they were putting on it. And the formulas coming from a lot of major brands were not focused on the natural biology of our skin.” (Di Pietro).</p><p name="000b" id="000b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This mission of body care importance led Ayssa to formulate one of Miami Beach Bum’s line breakthrough products, the “Bum + Body Cream,” which is an oregano cream that targets the skin’s natural ecosystem. It brings bacteria, yeast, and fungi that make up the skin’s microbiome back into homeostasis.</p><p name="6ebf" id="6ebf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So, there was this niche that I really entered with our signature Bum + Body Cream which was really formulating for the skin’s natural biology to restore skin health and that’s how I kind of switched from my coastal engineering career which was a little boring and dry to much more exciting launching my own brand then using that chemistry background to making emulsions.” (Di Pietro).</p><p name="6dfb" id="6dfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Miami Beach Bum is revolutionizing how consumers and the beauty industry view the importance of body care. Even more so, with Ayssa’s brilliant study of the biological functions and combining them with her excellence in green chemistry, her formulations promote skin health longevity. The brand is perfect for those looking for a greener and cleaner way to help their skin, and the results are BOOM-BOOM- Tastic!</p><p name="9005" id="9005" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can listen to the full episode here:</p><figure name="eedf" id="eedf" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/4HvFXO0XkPwT3zcFLhhZRm?utm_source=oembed" width="456" height="152" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><div name="bf5f" id="bf5f" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--figure"><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000575712288" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000575712288" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000575712288"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">‎Skincare Anarchy: E.330: Miami Beach Bum Exclusive Launch Feature on Apple Podcasts</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">In this episode Ekta chats with the founder of the body care line, Miami Beach Bum!
