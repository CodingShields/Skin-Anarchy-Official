It has changed the way we communicate, access information, and even consume products. As social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have grown in popularity, so has the concept of “influencer marketing.” This is where brands pay individuals with a large following on social media to promote their products to their audience. However, there has been a growing trend towards “deinfluencing” as people become more aware of the potential negative impacts of influencer culture.</p><p name="c727" id="c727" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deinfluencing refers to the process of intentionally reducing or eliminating the influence of social media influencers from our lives. This can take many forms, from unfollowing influencers on social media to boycotting products endorsed by them. The rise of deinfluencing is driven by concerns over the authenticity and transparency of influencer content, as well as the potential for influencers to promote unhealthy or harmful products.</p><p name="f9c7" id="f9c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is not yet a lot of data on the phenomenon of deinfluencing, as it is a relatively new concept. However, a few studies have begun to explore the reasons behind it and its potential impact on social media and influencer marketing.</p><figure name="3bac" id="3bac" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*kGePox6EhqUtz6Q9N3W8RQ.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="6240" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kGePox6EhqUtz6Q9N3W8RQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="4f9b" id="4f9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Deciphering The #Deinfluencing Data:</strong></p><p name="7823" id="7823" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One study by the marketing firm Stackla found that 86% of consumers say authenticity is important when deciding which brands to support. This suggests that influencers who are seen as inauthentic or overly promotional may be less effective in driving consumer behavior. The study also found that 57% of consumers are influenced by content created by friends and family, compared to just 21% who are influenced by content from influencers.</p><p name="b72f" id="b72f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another study by Morning Consult found that nearly half of consumers have unfollowed an influencer in the past year, with the top reasons being a lack of authenticity (64%), too much sponsored content (51%), and promoting harmful or offensive products (44%).</p><p name="9ed2" id="9ed2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is also evidence that deinfluencing is having an impact on the influencer marketing industry. A survey by the influencer marketing platform Klear found that 38% of marketers say they have seen a decrease in the effectiveness of influencer marketing due to the rise of deinfluencing. This may be due to the fact that consumers are becoming more skeptical of influencer content and are seeking out more authentic sources of information and recommendations.</p><p name="83de" id="83de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It is clear that deinfluencing is a trend that is here to stay. As consumers become more aware of the potential negative impacts of influencer culture, they are taking action to reduce or eliminate the influence of social media influencers in their lives. While there is still much to learn about the impact of deinfluencing on social media and influencer marketing, it is clear that brands and influencers need to adapt to these changing consumer preferences in order to remain effective in the years to come.</p></div></div></section><section name="e28d" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="7a4a" id="7a4a" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">WORKS CITED</p><p name="f08f" id="f08f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Influencer Marketing Hub.
