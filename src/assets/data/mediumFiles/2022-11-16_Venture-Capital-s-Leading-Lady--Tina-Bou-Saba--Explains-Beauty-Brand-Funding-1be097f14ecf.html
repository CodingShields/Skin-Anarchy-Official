Verity Venture Partners specializes in innovators with a strong sense of vision who are creating the next wave of successful consumer businesses, particularly up-and-coming brands and the technologies that support them.</p><figure name="fed5" id="fed5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*D6IbPxk4htdN30u-4bIYlw.jpeg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*D6IbPxk4htdN30u-4bIYlw.jpeg"></figure><p name="4cf1" id="4cf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Since 2016, Tina has been investing significantly through CXT Investments, her own investment fund, with a concentration on e-commerce, empowering technology, health and wellness, personal care, and beauty.</p><p name="1e71" id="1e71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tina says that she “saw an opportunity to be not only an investor but more importantly, a partner to founders at that emerging brand stage (Bou-Saba).”</p><p name="d0b4" id="d0b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She discusses that she “was really focused on understanding what is happening here, and how [she] can be a fantastic partner to the extraordinary partners, which led [her] to the last part of the story, how can [she] then leverage what [she’s] built as an individual into a bigger business with a team and writing bigger checks, meeting deals, and rising outside the capital. That is what led [her] to form Verity Venture Partners (Bou-Saba).”</p><p name="b45c" id="b45c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She says that she and the team “would look at things in three broad buckets, one is product market fit that is to the business, the brand, and the attraction. Then the second bucket would be founders, and the third bucket is more around the investment because for us they are very mindful of what success looks like and how we can work with founders to importantly manage delusion along the way and ensure that a successful exit is indeed going to be successful for founders, teams and so on (Bou-Saba).”</p><p name="35fc" id="35fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As she is always searching for that brand DNA, she also “looks for highly engaged user communities (Bou-Saba).”</p><p name="a21c" id="a21c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not only that but she thinks that “building relationships early with promising businesses and talented founders is an important part of what [they] consider to be [their] deal sourcing. You really have to have very crisp differentiation which may be around the product, founder or distribution strategy but there certainly has to be something that is very differentiated, to feel confident and the ability of a new brand to face the scale (Bou-Saba).”</p><p name="2080" id="2080" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tina depicts that they “are deep in the beauty, health, and wellness space, and certainly believe there are pockets or subcategories that are much less crowded than others (Bou-Saba).”</p><p name="b025" id="b025" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tina is a creative, innovative, independent thinker, and a dependable business partner. She has a keen eye for business opportunities. She started out her career in investment banking at Morgan Stanley and later worked as an equities analyst at Sanford Bernstein and Berman Capital, where she focused on the retail sector. She has extensive expertise in the sector, including e-commerce, specialized retail, and mass retail. Tina led significant quantitative and qualitative customer research while working directly with Victoria’s Secret executives to generate new revenue potential. She was a Baker Scholar and attended Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard College, and Harvard Business School.</p><p name="ed6a" id="ed6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Written By: Yaren Ay</p><p name="dd45" id="dd45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Be sure to follow our social media channels below:<br>Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</a><br>Spotify Podcast: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</a><br>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</a><br>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</a><br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" data-href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</a><br>Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</a><br>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</a><br>Pinterest: <a href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" data-href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</a><br>TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</a></p></div></div></section>
