One can make informed shopping decisions and contribute to changing the market when one is aware of the ingredients in the products they bring into their home and how those chemicals could damage their health and the environment. In addition, some brands support appropriate business and governmental policies to safeguard the most disadvantaged individuals.</p><figure name="80fa" id="80fa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Nr8gX7myxLnZF-67" data-width="4500" data-height="5500" data-unsplash-photo-id="wy7OK3cFqAY" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Nr8gX7myxLnZF-67"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pmvch?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@pmvch?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">pmv chamara</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="228f" id="228f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What number of personal care items does one use each day? 2,300 people participated in a survey that was conducted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and revealed that respondents consume nine products a day on average. There are 126 distinct ingredients in them. One out of every 100 men and 25% of the women surveyed use 15 or more products daily.</p><p name="c2f2" id="c2f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An increasing number of women are asking precisely what those substances are and what they represent for their bodies in 2022 and beyond.</p><p name="f6bf" id="f6bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to <a href="https://www.nosto.com/wp-content/uploads/beauty-skincare-consumer-report-2021.pdf" data-href="https://www.nosto.com/wp-content/uploads/beauty-skincare-consumer-report-2021.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent research report from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">nosto</em></a>, 68% of consumers are searching for products that are “clean,” and 59% are persuaded by those that are “natural and organic.”</p><p name="83ad" id="83ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Women are also looking for increased transparency from beauty firms, according to a <a href="https://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Article/2020/06/10/Clean-beauty-labels-lack-transparency-say-consumers-in-Bazaarvoice-Influenster-survey" data-href="https://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Article/2020/06/10/Clean-beauty-labels-lack-transparency-say-consumers-in-Bazaarvoice-Influenster-survey" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global 2020 poll</a>; 61% of respondents felt that brands didn’t go far enough to clarify the “clean” or “green” terminology on their product packaging.</p><p name="9574" id="9574" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To find out if the chemicals were safe, nearly 70% of women searched for additional sources using tools like Google.</p><p name="812e" id="812e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">10,500 different chemicals are used in the production of personal care products, a number of which are recognized or potential carcinogens, hazardous to the reproductive system, or confirmed to interfere with the endocrine system. While some businesses produce foods that are harmless to consume, others decide to employ harmful components like lead acetate, a developmental toxin, coal tar, and formaldehyde, all of which are human carcinogens.</p><p name="6c7a" id="6c7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The synthetic chemicals used to make personal care products or the chemical industry, in general, do not need to undergo marketing authorization safety testing. The federal Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Cosmetics and Colors says that “a cosmetic manufacturer may use almost any raw material as a cosmetic ingredient and market the product without approval from FDA” (FDA, 2012). The FDA does not conduct methodical safety evaluations; rather, it permits the cosmetics industry to independently regulate ingredient safety through its Cosmetics Ingredient Review panel. Only 11 substances have been rejected by this industry council as being dangerous for use in cosmetics over its 36-year history (CIR 2012). The European Union, however, has outlawed dozens of chemicals in cosmetics (European Commission, 2012).</p><p name="5481" id="5481" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The risks are great when hazardous substances are utilized in cosmetics. These are not traces of pollutants that can be found in food or water in parts-per-million or even parts-per-billion. They have a significant role in the product, much like how flour is a key component of bread.</p><p name="af3a" id="af3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Experts predict that if cosmetics firms can manage the demand to provide truly natural and organic products, their sales will increase.</p><p name="5a33" id="5a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the next five years, the value of the global market for cosmetics and natural beauty products is expected to increase by more than $18 billion.</p><p name="a5cd" id="a5cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The market for natural and organic beauty products is still being driven by the rising popularity of healthy and active lifestyles. Stores are rushing to expand the selection of natural and organic items in response to the rising consumer demand for healthier items. According to a study by Infinium Global Research titled “Organic Personal Care and Cosmetics Products Market (By Product Type — Skin Care, Hair Care, Oral Care, Makeup or Color Cosmetics, and Others; By Distribution Channel — Organized Retail Store, Online Sale, and Convenient Store) Global Industry Analysis, Trends, Size, Share, and Forecasts to 2026,” the industry for natural cosmetics and personal care products is expected to exceed up to 26,600 million in 2026 (Infinium Global Research, 2020).</p><p name="5342" id="5342" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The value of the global market for natural cosmetics and personal care products is projected to rise from just under 30 billion dollars in 2021 to around 50.5 billion dollars in 2027. These statistics demonstrate the market for natural and organic beauty products increasing relevance. In truth, customers’ comprehension of the kinds of items they buy is evolving throughout history. This is particularly true when it comes to consumer products for personal use. When it comes to cosmetics specifically, a growing percentage of shoppers choose to buy natural and/or organic products. Cosmetics are regarded as natural in terms of two crucial areas: ingredients and manufacturing. However, the lack of regulation on the matter and the discrepancy between administrative interpretations and private norms for natural cosmetics lead to uncertainty in the cosmetics sector.</p><p name="e678" id="e678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Globally, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the remainder of the world are the regions that make up the global market for organic personal care and cosmetic goods. The market for organic personal care and cosmetics is dominated by North America, followed by Asia Pacific. Innovative start-ups are providing trendy natural, organic, cruelty-free, clean products to young consumers who are more aware and expect visibility in product components, packaging, sustainability, and ethical sourcing, which drives demand for the goods in the North American market (PR Newswire, 2020). The desire for North America’s organic personal care and cosmetics market is fueled in part by North Americans’ high purchasing power. Additionally, the desire for natural personal care and cosmetics goods in the Asia Pacific region is being fueled by rising health consciousness among consumers and increased demand for clean-label products.</p><p name="fc07" id="fc07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sources:</p><p name="7b97" id="7b97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/learn_more/why-skin-deep/" data-href="https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/learn_more/why-skin-deep/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/learn_more/why-skin-deep/</a></p><p name="b06d" id="b06d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.nosto.com/wp-content/uploads/beauty-skincare-consumer-report-2021.pdf" data-href="https://www.nosto.com/wp-content/uploads/beauty-skincare-consumer-report-2021.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.nosto.com/wp-content/uploads/beauty-skincare-consumer-report-2021.pdf</a></p><p name="6a2c" id="6a2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/673641/global-market-value-for-natural-cosmetics/" data-href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/673641/global-market-value-for-natural-cosmetics/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/statistics/673641/global-market-value-for-natural-cosmetics/</a></p><p name="0d66" id="0d66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/organic-personal-care-and-cosmetics-products-market-to-generate-revenues-of-over-26-6-billion-by-2026---infinium-global-research-301061394.html" data-href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/organic-personal-care-and-cosmetics-products-market-to-generate-revenues-of-over-26-6-billion-by-2026---infinium-global-research-301061394.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/organic-personal-care-and-cosmetics-products-market-to-generate-revenues-of-over-26-6-billion-by-2026---infinium-global-research-301061394.html</a></p><p name="4a26" id="4a26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Written By: Yaren Ay</p><p name="92b2" id="92b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Be sure to follow our social media channels below:<br>Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</a><br>Spotify Podcast: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</a><br>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</a><br>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</a><br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" data-href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</a><br>Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</a><br>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</a><br>Pinterest: <a href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" data-href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</a><br>TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</a></p></div></div></section>
