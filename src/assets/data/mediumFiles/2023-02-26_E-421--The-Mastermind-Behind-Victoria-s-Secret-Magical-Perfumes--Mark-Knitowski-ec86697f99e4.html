Throughout the episode, Knitowski discusses his experiences working in the fragrance industry and his role in creating the magical fragrances of Victoria’s Secret.</p><figure name="bb8e" id="bb8e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*9dFM7Hoh94Bt3QD3s_qy2w@2x.jpeg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9dFM7Hoh94Bt3QD3s_qy2w@2x.jpeg"></figure><p name="9f8c" id="9f8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">At the start of the episode, Knitowski shares how he got into the fragrance industry, “I actually started my career at Estée Lauder in the mid-90s, and I was just fascinated by the whole process of creating a fragrance, from the ingredients to the storytelling behind it. I eventually moved over to Victoria’s Secret, where I became the head of fragrance development, and that’s where I really got to flex my creative muscles.”</p><figure name="9240" id="9240" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*BTFY1e2g16h0ms4PZkVwxw@2x.jpeg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BTFY1e2g16h0ms4PZkVwxw@2x.jpeg"></figure><p name="83a9" id="83a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Knitowski goes on to discuss the importance of storytelling in fragrance development, “Fragrances are very emotional things. They have the power to evoke memories and feelings, so it’s important to create a narrative around the fragrance. The best fragrances are the ones that have a story behind them.” He cites Victoria’s Secret’s Love Spell fragrance as an example, “Love Spell was all about falling in love. The fragrance had notes of cherry blossom, peach, and white jasmine, which were meant to evoke the feeling of falling in love.”</p><figure name="d5b6" id="d5b6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5R5nje9Eha8D9kyXhiAmmA@2x.jpeg" data-width="1080" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5R5nje9Eha8D9kyXhiAmmA@2x.jpeg"></figure><p name="3d90" id="3d90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Knitowski also touches on the technical aspects of fragrance development, “There’s a science to fragrance development. You have to balance the top, middle, and base notes, and you have to make sure the fragrance is stable over time. There’s also the challenge of working with natural ingredients, which can be volatile and unpredictable.” He explains that many fragrances contain a combination of natural and synthetic materials, which can help to create a more consistent scent.</p><p name="840e" id="840e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The podcast episode also covers the changing landscape of the fragrance industry, with Knitowski sharing his thoughts on the rise of niche fragrances, “The industry has definitely become more diverse, with more niche and artisanal fragrances emerging. I think consumers are becoming more adventurous and willing to try new things.” He also discusses the impact of social media on consumer preferences, “Social media has definitely had an impact on the industry. Consumers are more informed and more discerning about the products they buy. They’re also more interested in sustainability and eco-friendly practices.”</p><p name="41c3" id="41c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Overall, the episode provides a fascinating glimpse into the creative and technical aspects of fragrance development, as well as the changing trends and consumer preferences in the industry. Knitowski’s insights and expertise make for an engaging and informative discussion that will be of interest to anyone who is curious about the art of perfumery.</p></div></div></section><section name="b9e3" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d5e3" id="d5e3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">FOLLOW OUR SOCIALS:</p><p name="ddef" id="ddef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</p><p name="fb71" id="fb71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spotify Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</p><p name="abb4" id="abb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</p><p name="8a6c" id="8a6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</p><p name="95dc" id="95dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Twitter: https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</p><p name="b706" id="b706" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</p><p name="e2f9" id="e2f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</p><p name="f848" id="f848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pinterest: https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</p><p name="32c5" id="32c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</p><p name="9a26" id="9a26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medium Blog:</p><p name="4847" id="4847" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">https://skincareanarchy.medium.com</p></div></div></section>
