Veronique has 25 plus years of experience in the worlds of luxury, fashion, beauty, and fragrance, which gave her tremendous success as a brand builder. With the knowledge she gained working with huge brands such as L’Oreal, Vera Wang, and Giorgio Armani, she became an integral part of the development of their fragrance fields. Through her experience, she has not only developed successful brands such as Acqua di Gio for men but also introduced the Emporio Armani franchise. Veronique is a fragrance expert with abundant experience, which led her to create the significant luxury fragrance brand Veronique Gabai!</p><p name="7067" id="7067" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nothing in my career was planned, I followed my heart every step of the way. And I think that the passion I have for scent started when I was a small child. And the reality was that my sense of smell was/.PO0 very highly developed. And as a kid, it was really playing tricks on me, it was making me sick almost every day because when I had an overload of a bad scent I would throw up. So, scent and smell were making me sick very often at the same time. On the other hand, it would enchant me in a way that is hardly explainable to people. So, I never knew that you could have a career with scents, we didn’t know about perfumers or this type of work!” (Gabai-Pinsky).</p><p name="8aaf" id="8aaf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although she had little knowledge of the fragrance field, Veronique went into business school with no idea of what she wanted to pursue. But that path would soon lead her down her true passion fragrance! Her creative mind and love for scents allowed her to capture the eye of L’Oreal to make a massive impact in their fragrance division.</p><p name="6082" id="6082" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So, by elimination I went to business school. And when I say by elimination, I mean it! I didn’t know what I wanted to do, and I started to work my first full position, and I started in makeup and then a couple of years later L’Oreal told me my manger told me ‘You are a very creative person, and we want you to try to work on fragrance’. And I was moved to their luxury division for fragrance brands, and I fell in love completely with the pedigree I thought I was coming home.” (Gabai-Pinsky).</p><p name="11b6" id="11b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Veronique did not have the average journey into fragrance, but what Founder or CEO in this industry ever had a “normal” beginning? Beauty, Fashion, and Fragrance bring in individuals with creative minds who consistently change how consumers see the beauty of self-care brands. Veronique is precisely what the fragrance industry needs because not only does she love her career, but her mission is to cater to the needs of the consumer and their comfort and luxury through her innovative fragrance brand!</p><p name="72f7" id="72f7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I worked at LVMH I oversaw Gatland, and I had a chance to work with John Paul Gaultier directly. So, I was training in development then I understood with John Paul the beauty of natural ingredients and how you source them, and how you harvest them, and why is it so important in a composition…. My path has always been, if you will, a balance between business management and creativity and creation. And quite frankly my passion is in creation. I know how to manage a business but if I didn’t have the creative aspect of my work, I don’t think I would be very happy” (Gabai-Pinsky).</p><p name="7417" id="7417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can listen to the full episode here:</p><figure name="4c7d" id="4c7d" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/5TZNLg5qyZdLzdBJGc35Se?utm_source=oembed" width="456" height="152" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><div name="aa0b" id="aa0b" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--figure"><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000576661238" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000576661238" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000576661238"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">‎Skincare Anarchy: E.334: Veronique Gabai- Master Fragrance Expert: Exclusive Interview on Apple…</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Join us for a fragrance Friday series exclusive where we sit down with the Master of Scents, Veronique Gabai.
