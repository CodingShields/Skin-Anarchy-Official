Danessa redefines the idea of beauty as she is a self-taught Makeup Artist with only her passion and determination to lead the way.</p><p name="91a8" id="91a8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I call myself an accidental Makeup Artist, may be very similar to a lot of the listeners. I was just a woman, a single mom, who was working a job, feeling incredibly unfulfilled.” (Myricks).</p><p name="c980" id="c980" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She had her first taste of beauty working in a publishing company and experiencing the different personalities and talents that these amazing businesses inspired her. Unfortunately, the company shut down years later, and she would only have a few days before being unemployed.</p><p name="0923" id="0923" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It was a life-changing moment for me, [When her job was closing], I was 30 years old with two kids, one was just born, and I was like, ‘First of all, how could the rug be pulled out from under me just like that? Then second, do I want that to ever happen to me again?’, and I just decided on that day that I was going to do something different.” (Myricks).</p><p name="30fb" id="30fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, she took matters into her own hands and trained herself in the corporate and makeup world. When she found herself stuck, she tried to look back to see how so many beauty influencers and entrepreneurs are so successful and what made them stand out. After some volunteer work with different companies and photographers, she set her path.</p><p name="c35c" id="c35c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“In the meantime, I was begging people to allow me to participate in the industry, and I was fortunate to have one or two of the Photographers that would shoot for the magazine. They gave me the opportunity to come and sometimes just watch, other times participate. After a year of my own apprenticeship that I created for myself, I was able to really create a path for myself, and that’s how my career as a Makeup Artist began.” (Myricks).</p><p name="cdfb" id="cdfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Danessa knows what it is like to work from the ground up and that the industry is not only difficult to start in but to continue to strive in as well. She took the time and long hours to train herself not only in makeup and being creative and innovative to stand out but also in how to brand herself in such a competitive field. It is with her strength and passion for beauty that she has the success of Danessa Myricks Beauty and not only shows that anyone from any background can make a name for themselves in the beauty world.</p><p name="dd17" id="dd17" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Everything that happened in my career was accidental; the only thing that wasn’t accidental was me making a decision to be an entrepreneur and to do something different. Everything else was about taking advantage of the opportunities that fell in front of me, no matter how afraid I was to do it. That takes us to Danessa Myricks Beauty as it is today.” (Myricks).</p><p name="2d92" id="2d92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can listen to the full episode here:</p><figure name="26fc" id="26fc" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/17iwJjL3CEpjcY5ZuUWEnv?utm_source=oembed" width="456" height="152" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><div name="6e69" id="6e69" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--figure"><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000564092196" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000564092196" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000564092196"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">‎Skincare Anarchy: E.302: Exclusive Interview W/The Iconic GLOBAL MUA, Danessa Myricks on Apple…</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Danessa Myricks Is Re-Defining Beauty Norms And Leading The Way Towards Diversity Join us for an exclusive interview…</em>podcasts.apple.com</a><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000564092196" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="473ebcfa29b1de3ff9cbc9b8fed112a7" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*edYkYLNwM3CA3Z_d" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*edYkYLNwM3CA3Z_d);"></a></div><p name="6ad0" id="6ad0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed">Authors: Remy Vidal &amp; Jasmine Boskent</p><p name="f670" id="f670" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Be sure to follow our social media channels below:</p><p name="2534" id="2534" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</a></p><p name="32ba" id="32ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spotify Podcast: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</a></p><p name="e290" id="e290" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</a></p><p name="134f" id="134f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</a></p><p name="21b5" id="21b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" data-href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</a></p><p name="c967" id="c967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</a></p><p name="c785" id="c785" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</a></p><p name="dcda" id="dcda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pinterest: <a href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" data-href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</a></p><p name="27e6" id="27e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</a></p></div></div></section>
