Although it’s simple to write off gold-infused beauty products as a novelty, plated recipes frequently provide the (24K) magic that’s been absent from your regimen.</p><figure name="d209" id="d209" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*9e2-VIvGWRSUCIWBvqN7kw.jpeg" data-width="8688" data-height="5792" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9e2-VIvGWRSUCIWBvqN7kw.jpeg"></figure><p name="214d" id="214d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Gold is used in several ways in cosmetics. The most prevalent component of gold-concentrated items is colloidal gold, which is made up of tiny granules dissolved in a liquid (usually water). Along with other things, it prevents aging, lessens inflammation and redness, and promotes skin healing.</p><p name="ac94" id="ac94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The true essence of the component is 24K gold. Everything from collagen deficiency to irregular skin complexion is quickly addressed when it is applied to masks, patches, moisturizers, and other products. You may rely on this accomplished multitasker to lessen peroxidation, prevent collagen deterioration, and aid in skin regeneration.</p><p name="885c" id="885c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally, companies are digging for new precious ingredients to put in bottles. A collagen-boosting peptide like the recently found gold heptapeptide, for instance, substantially reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by permeating the deepest layers of the skin. The lesson of the tale is that gold’s influence continues to grow.</p><p name="52f5" id="52f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it concerns cosmetics, gold has a significant influence as it does when it comes to being dazzling, glittery, and appealing to the eye. Natalie Aguilar, a well-known celebrity aesthetician and dermatological nurse, claims that micronized flecks of gold can give our skin a golden, glowing tone in addition to being a sumptuous product.</p><p name="2719" id="2719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, Aguilar chose to have a gold-infused treatment before getting married because the shine is so genuine. The morning of her wedding, she gave herself a gold facial because she really desired her skin to glow and appear tight. “It worked wonderfully under my makeup and reflected beautifully in my photos”, she says. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that these facials are popular around award season.</p><p name="69a1" id="69a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, gold is thought to offer more than just a surface-level glow. Gold can also act as a physical barrier to insulate our skin from the elements, preserving the collagen we value so much, according to the expert. Additionally, the substance is well known for its antioxidant capabilities.</p><p name="7820" id="7820" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There aren’t many people who don’t like to look a little more radiant, but gold can be especially helpful for people who have what La Prairie’s director of development Daniel Stangl, PhD, and head of strategic innovation and research Jacqueline Hill, PhD, refer to as “devitalized skin.”</p><p name="cbb8" id="cbb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Swiss skincare company recently announced its Pure Gold Collection, which is based on the yellow metal and targets dry, dull, and delicate skin. The product range contains submicron gold particles that carry more active compounds into the skin’s layers for long-term smoothing and toning effects, as well as big gold particles (for an immediate shine). They state that “the [collection] is particularly suited for dull skin, for dry and dehydrated skin, and for skin that has lost its youthful vitality.”</p><p name="fd0e" id="fd0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whether you want to incorporate gold into your skincare routine, it’s crucial to choose a treatment that not only contains gold but also has elements that are suitable for your skin type. The best part is that gold gets along nicely with other active ingredients and isn’t designed to possess people more sensitive to the sun. According to Azama, gold can refract 99 percent of light and is utilized by NASA to filter radiation within space shuttles and spacesuits.</p><p name="2bb5" id="2bb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet another factor? the product’s form. Aguilar says that a leave-on mask, serum, or moisturizer is better than a rinse-off product because gold typically works best while left on the skin. The key is persistence. She says, “in order for gold to be beneficial to the skin, it should be in a product that can be used daily such as a serum or moisturizer,” she continues. “We want this element to protect our skin and using it for just one day isn’t enough.”</p><p name="8ee4" id="8ee4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here are some of the best skincare products with gold:</p><p name="221b" id="221b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Peter Thomas Roth 24K Gold Mask Pure Luxury Lift &amp; Firm $85.00</p><p name="5b79" id="5b79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Physicians Formula 24-Karat Gold Collagen Serum $16.00</p><p name="e482" id="e482" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chantecaille Gold Recovery Mask $275.00</p><p name="c48b" id="c48b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">ZPM 24K Advanced Gold Serum $15.00</p><p name="0e2d" id="0e2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ahava 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask $68.00</p><p name="ba21" id="ba21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sources: <a href="https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-gold-for-skin-care/" data-href="https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-gold-for-skin-care/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-gold-for-skin-care/</a></p><p name="de73" id="de73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.beautylish.com/a/vzsry/benefits-of-gold-in-skincare" data-href="https://www.beautylish.com/a/vzsry/benefits-of-gold-in-skincare" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.beautylish.com/a/vzsry/benefits-of-gold-in-skincare</a><br> <a href="https://aedit.com/aedition/benefits-of-gold-in-skincare" data-href="https://aedit.com/aedition/benefits-of-gold-in-skincare" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://aedit.com/aedition/benefits-of-gold-in-skincare</a></p><p name="e628" id="e628" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.byrdie.com/gold-for-skin-5194581" data-href="https://www.byrdie.com/gold-for-skin-5194581" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.byrdie.com/gold-for-skin-5194581</a></p><p name="d4aa" id="d4aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Written By: Yaren Ay</p><p name="8234" id="8234" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Be sure to follow our social media channels below:<br>Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</a><br>Spotify Podcast: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</a><br>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</a><br>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</a><br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" data-href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</a><br>Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</a><br>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</a><br>Pinterest: <a href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" data-href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</a><br>TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener ugc nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</a></p></div></div></section>
