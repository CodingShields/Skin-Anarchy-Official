I think that there is a misconception in not only the beauty industry, but also the science community that impacts beauty, wellness and health industries. The micro biome is an incredibly complex culmination of various fields of study, and involves many subdisciplines, such as immunology, toxicology, microbiology, virology, proteomics, genomics, and many chemical reactions that we still have yet to understand.</p><figure name="981c" id="981c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Uh0tilhPTDT5xhyOaEcT5Q@2x.jpeg" data-width="610" data-height="610" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uh0tilhPTDT5xhyOaEcT5Q@2x.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/microbiomics</figcaption></figure><p name="8d5f" id="8d5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Basically, it is really crucial now, more than ever, to start understanding what makes bacteria so helpful for our skin. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Is it the fact that they live together on our skin and contribute in a colony or population format? Or is it, that they secrete certain factors, or enzymes that facilitate the lysing, or breaking of naturally occurring compounds found in the skin barrier, as well as the breakdown of any metabolites from skin cells? (Or something else entirely)</strong></p><blockquote name="3998" id="3998" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Not to mention that we aren’t just talking Bacteria here. The skin’s micro BIOME equates to all micro ORGANISMS on the surface (I.e. fungi, viruses, other stuff like spores, etc)</blockquote><figure name="7bc3" id="7bc3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yYIbVGFd3-HpSTjddu41MA@2x.jpeg" data-width="2953" data-height="2210" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yYIbVGFd3-HpSTjddu41MA@2x.jpeg"></figure><p name="3afc" id="3afc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To understand anything in the field of science, much less something as complex as science on a micro level, we must stick to the tried, and true bench research methods that have been utilized for decades to understand aspects such as gene expression, protein expression, and also the interactions between them. These are complex studies and also very time consuming. Therefore, it is interesting to evaluate the world of Microbiome over the counter products from a business standpoint, or, rather, I should say, economical standpoint. In other words, it would be very expensive for a brand to not only figure out what the real methodology is behind why bacteria are so helpful for our skin, skin barrier, as well as overall metabolism.</p><p name="f28c" id="f28c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, when it comes to the idea of isolating something of value from any of the organisms that compromise the Microbiome of most individuals, there are several hurdles in terms of R&amp;D, but more practically, the application of the new biotechnology.</p><p name="88d7" id="88d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Application is genuinely the largest hurdle that we face as an industry. In true practicality of principles outlined above, we simply don’t know how to apply this technology efficiently in a topical system yet.</p><p name="d3bb" id="d3bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, just gonna mention that as we all know: no one’s Microbiome is the same and so most likely this will need to be an individualized experience for consumers and not something we can create on mass scale levels. Small batches would be key!</p><p name="9e48" id="9e48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In conclusion, do I think the Microbiome is an area worth investing in for the new year? Yea absolutely! The more money we can pour into this field , the better. Heck, I say we work to somehow get the NIH more involved as a collective medical community backed by the leading executives of the multi billion dollar otc companies.</p><p name="72bf" id="72bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Excited to see what’s coming next.</p><p name="fd80" id="fd80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thanks for reading,</p><p name="6083" id="6083" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dr Ekta Y</p><p name="7fad" id="7fad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">MD MBA MS</p></div></div></section><section name="30ba" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="98db" id="98db" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">For Further Reading:</p><p name="9e5b" id="9e5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260144" data-href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260144" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260144</a></p><p name="9c61" id="9c61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Acknowledgement: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-weiss-8865453" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-weiss-8865453" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Larry Weiss</a> (Founder of <a href="https://symbiome.com/shop?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=Brand_Rm_Pur_Search&amp;utm_adgroup=%7Badgroup%7D&amp;utm_term=symbiome%20skincare&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAkfucBhBBEiwAFjbkr5gEcV-HrLwfHJ2J5mmRyiFsV0-hcBZTgftunw0gYJ_X3NVIXPfyWBoCQFcQAvD_BwE" data-href="https://symbiome.com/shop?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=Brand_Rm_Pur_Search&amp;utm_adgroup=%7Badgroup%7D&amp;utm_term=symbiome%20skincare&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAkfucBhBBEiwAFjbkr5gEcV-HrLwfHJ2J5mmRyiFsV0-hcBZTgftunw0gYJ_X3NVIXPfyWBoCQFcQAvD_BwE" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Symbiome</a>)</p></div></div></section>
