As David grew up in his small Mid-Western town of LaSalle, Illinois, becoming a barber was a dream that was always on his mind. But he would soon learn that the techniques of barbering and haircare would intertwine for him in ways he could never have imagined!</p><p name="9a87" id="9a87" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You know I just I decided it might be a cool thing to try barbering. So, I ended up going to barber school in the late 70s which was not a very good time to go to barber school. It was when that was a very classic grooming at its finest you know. You think of the late 70s it was a lot of like long hair and men were being a lot more experimental. It was kind of an androgenous time you know Bowie and different people. And I was really you know quite into the classic barbering.” (Raccuglia).</p><p name="70f1" id="70f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although he always had an interest in classical hairstyles such as the slick back looks seen as a child by the men and boys in his Italian family. David opened himself up to the world of salon care and combined those techniques with Barbery. But throughout his training in London and teaching worldwide, he saw few options for men in the haircare space.</p><p name="6731" id="6731" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I decided one day that I just you know after working predominantly in the female category I decided I wanted to do a book on men’s hair because I loved the techniques and classics of cutting so much! So, I ended up doing a book on men’s grooming and I became kind of known for having a technical excellence in cutting men’s hair. And then from doing that book I realized how little options there were in the men’s grooming category.” (Raccuglia).</p><p name="d61c" id="d61c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From that moment on, David worked tirelessly to formulate a line to promote men’s haircare and revolutionize the idea that all men’s hair is the same. He sees that the category of men’s hairstyles is also changing the effort of care and management, which brings us to the brilliant brand American Crew!</p><p name="794a" id="794a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Most of the information that you can gain on the right products all began with the hair cut you’re wearing and how much time you’re willing to commit to it. You know like, for instance, most men, I think I’ve read the percentages this high in the 90 percent category have hair three inches or shorter. And if you’re wearing, you know if you look at the male groomer in that category that’s gonna cut down the amount of time they spend on their hair. So, you know short hair predominates. However, that’s changed drastically. New generations are wearing their hair much longer and are much more interested in very idiosyncratic textures.” (Raccuglia).</p><p name="c018" id="c018" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can listen to the full episode here:</p><figure name="0252" id="0252" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/369a8Fxmh4gOvL083LvACM?utm_source=oembed" width="456" height="152" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><div name="5656" id="5656" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--figure"><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000578357166" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000578357166" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000578357166"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">‎Skincare Anarchy: E341: Labor Day Special Ft.
