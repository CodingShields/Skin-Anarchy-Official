The moderate event highlights the four unique brands, essano, Triumph &amp; Disaster, Ethique, and anihana, to discuss with the founders their journey in representing the skincare culture of one of the most magnificent lushes geographics on the planet!</p><p name="2e16" id="2e16" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“My journey started about six years ago, I was a florist for ten years and I always loved creating beautiful things. I was working for a lady that owned a soap manufacturing company, so I used to sell the soaps and the bath bombs with the flowers. An opportunity arouse, I just had happened to be 8 months pregnant at the time, to buy this manufacturing business. And so, I jokingly said to my husband one night “shall we buy it.” And a couple of months later we had a new business and a baby, so it was a very full-on busy time for us!” (Sophie Cooper of Anihana).</p><p name="e03f" id="e03f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we look through each of their journeys, they all have the same goal to promote the beauty of natural ingredients that New Zealand and several regions of the world can provide!</p><p name="435e" id="435e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I had, it was just studying at New York University, and I started and sold a couple of businesses, basically the only point to those businesses was money masking. While I was studying, I was studying Biology and Chemistry at university, so I had some interesting skills and I really wanted to combine a couple of passions, one which was business, the other which was my passion for the environment. And I always had this belief that business is the way to solve so many of our social and environmental problems.” (Brianna West of Ethique).</p><p name="c11d" id="c11d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each founder has a unique background in the business and skincare worlds, but through that, they all gained tremendous experience that has allowed them to create such successful brands.</p><p name="6eff" id="6eff" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We started in 2011, and for me and my introduction to business was quite late. I retired from sputum when I was 30 and I ended up working for a New Zealand vodka brand called 42 Below which was my sort of business 101 if you’d like. And there was an exciting time in New Zealand with business they were sort of a young adventurous company that were trying to take on the world in vodka. You know pedaling bottles was a long way from skincare, so it was a really great introduction to sales and branding and sort of learning about business for me!” (Dion Nash of Triumph &amp; Disaster).</p><p name="fc0c" id="fc0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through all their trials and tribulations, these founders have made revolutionary strides in the meaning of natural beauty in skincare!</p><p name="5ecb" id="5ecb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So, we started the business actually 22 years ago, (showing my age) and literally we started men’s hair styling products. One product we started making in the back of a barber shop at nighttime and friends around for beer and pizzas to paint the product. Our skincare journey started in an unusual way, we built up this business and built a couple of great brands in the skincare space. But really the short stick change for us was about nine years ago. Our wonderful wives were looking for great natural skincare products and they were getting much more aware about the problems with synthetic products in your skincare. And I couldn’t find anything that was very accessible and affordable and so we had set up this great factory with cosmetic chemists and they really encouraged us and pushed us along to look at this skin category!” (Anthony Gadsdon of Essano).</p><p name="b30a" id="b30a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can listen to the full episode here:</p><figure name="20a3" id="20a3" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/4ArkA5HeFYSvDHkqoXcg7o?utm_source=oembed" width="456" height="152" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><div name="1585" id="1585" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--figure"><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000578788765" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000578788765" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000578788765"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">‎Skincare Anarchy: E343: New Zealand Skincare Panel Discussion on Apple Podcasts</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">In this very special episode, join Ekta for a moderated event that show cases four amazing brands representing the skin…</em>podcasts.apple.com</a><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686?i=1000578788765" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="e3ad96a4ae4cd2cdb762b6a8e15ce1f7" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*IwsF3kqMbHtNIAbq" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*IwsF3kqMbHtNIAbq);"></a></div><p name="7a20" id="7a20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed">Authors: Jasmine Boskent &amp; Remy Vidal</p><p name="bcfe" id="bcfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Be sure to follow our social media channels:</p><p name="b0b3" id="b0b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple Podcast: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</a></p><p name="65de" id="65de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spotify Podcast: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</a></p><p name="3bd5" id="3bd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</a></p><p name="af33" id="af33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</a></p><p name="b19b" id="b19b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" data-href="https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</a></p><p name="2188" id="2188" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</a></p><p name="857a" id="857a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</a></p><p name="90fa" id="90fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pinterest: <a href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" data-href="https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</a></p><p name="3c63" id="3c63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</a></p></div></div></section>
