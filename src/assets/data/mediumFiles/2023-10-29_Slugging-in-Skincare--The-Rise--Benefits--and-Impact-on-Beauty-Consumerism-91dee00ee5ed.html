The trend involves applying a thick layer of occlusive skincare products, usually petroleum jelly like Vaseline or Aquaphor to the face before bed — to lock in moisture and achieve a dewy complexion.</p><p name="cd30" id="cd30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you have scrolled through the skin care hacks on social media, primarily TikTok, you’ve most likely seen influencers posting their dewy skin, promoting the trend of “slugging.” It is no wonder why the bizarre technique has become popular among skincare enthusiasts and social media, raising concerns about consumerism and its impact on the beauty industry.</p><p name="4ac3" id="4ac3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although, according to some dermatologists it can be a great way to trap moisture and heal the damaged skin. Now, of course, if you are a skincare addict or someone who enjoys trying out new skincare products/techniques and has been curious about the trend. Here’s what you should know:</p><p name="ce6e" id="ce6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why has slugging become popular?</strong></p><p name="eb92" id="eb92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Slugging has gained popularity due to social media influence — a place where skincare enthusiasts and influencers gather to share their experiences and results. The visual appeal andexposure to slugging has encouraged others to try the method, resulting in popularity.</p><p name="9a08" id="9a08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many individuals have claimed to wake up with hydrated and glowing skin after slugging into their nighttime skincare routine. Hence, visible results and positive feedback have fueled slugging into the trending category. It is also a counter-cultural shift in the beauty industry –challenging the notion that effective skincare requires only a few products, resonating with those who want a more minimalist approach to beauty.</p><p name="a870" id="a870" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are the benefits of slugging?</strong></p><p name="cfb5" id="cfb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is important to remember that slugging, unfortunately, does not work for EVERYONE. Don’t panic! Because everyone may not be you — Slugging offers skin hydration and moisture retention— with the ability to retain moisture in the skin. It creates a barrier with petroleum jelly, allowing the skin’s natural moisture to be sealed. This method is very beneficial for individuals with dry skin — improving skin texture.</p><p name="fe8f" id="fe8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Slugging can also be an affordable skincare option — Who does not love a good cost-effective skincare method? Since petroleum jelly is a commonly used occlusive product, available and inexpensive. Because of this, the trend is accessible to a wider audience! And individuals can utilize it in their skincare routine without breaking the bank! Yay! So far so good!</p><p name="e33c" id="e33c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And, of course, slugging offers a quite simple and convenient skincare routine, so you do not need to spend hours in the bathroom (like some people). All you need to do is apply a thin layer of the jelly before going to bed. We do love a lazy skincare routine!</p><p name="110f" id="110f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Can you slug your face every day?</strong></p><p name="d43e" id="d43e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An important rule to remember! You should not slug every day — you need to be aware of your skin’s needs and overall health before frequently using a product/method. Though, those with dry skin can benefit from slugging daily, those with oily skin should most definitely not.</p><p name="892c" id="892c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, one should slug 2–3 times per week to maintain results. Perhaps implement it in your nightly routine to heal dry, cracked, or inflamed skin.</p><p name="f2cd" id="f2cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are the downsides?</strong></p><p name="3894" id="3894" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ah yes, the downsides of slugging — as said earlier, slugging is not for everyone. If you have acne-prone or sensitive skin, DO NOT SLUG! Why? It will irritate your skin more, causing it to break out because adding a thick layer of jelly may clog pores for some people.</p><p name="328b" id="328b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, your skin will erupt, leaving breakouts and existing acne issues. So next time you think about slugging, remember that it can be counterproductive for acne-prone and sensitive skin.</p><p name="1c5a" id="1c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And while slugging culture is a “one size fits all” approach it may not address specific skincare concerns. That being, individuals have unique skin types, sensitivities, and conditions. It is important to not rely on occlusives or overlook the importance of proper skincare routines. Perhaps ask your dermatologist for advice — they are definitely the best option to know if your skin can handle such a routine.</p><p name="89b3" id="89b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some individuals may also become overly reliant on slugging, believing that it is the sole skincare method to achieve a glowy look. The outcome — it can limit the use of other beneficial products that the skin needs such as serums, treatments, sunscreen, and other products for specific skin issues.</p><p name="381c" id="381c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Does slugging have an impact on the consumerism of the beauty industry if any?</strong></p><p name="637d" id="637d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like most trends, slugging has an impact on the consumerism of the beauty industry. However, it is available to everyone and affordable. The trend has fueled a culture of excessive consumption.</p><p name="73aa" id="73aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For one, individuals are encouraged to purchase a specific product only for slugging purposes.</p><p name="b886" id="b886" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sounds harmless right?… Well. No — it has contributed to the rise of excessive consumerism, sparking demand for occlusive products only, reducing the demand for specialized products.</p><p name="6390" id="6390" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As consumers become more fixated on petroleum jelly, they will neglect the various products available in the market. Thus, a reduction in product diversity will be seen and can limit the exploration of innovative skincare solutions for various skin concerns. Ignoring the benefits of active ingredients found in specially designed moisturizers — ingredients like vitamins, antioxidants, and peptides for anti-aging, brightening, or acne-fighting properties, and missing out on other effective skincare products.</p><p name="ea96" id="ea96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What makes slugging intriguing is not just the skincare technique but its underlying logic that challenges the traditional narrative of consumerism in the beauty industry. Slugging no doubt promotes the idea of simplicity and effectiveness, motivating consumers to instead rely on simple and affordable skincare products and methods, in other words, promoting widely accessible products like Vaseline.</p><p name="92af" id="92af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now wait… There is more — though there is an exceptional reason slugging cannot be ignored because of its inexpensiveness, it has saturated high-end skincare products. Why? Well because slugging reminds buyers that effective skincare does not have to come with a heavy price tag. So, it does shift the challenges that quality does not always have to be determined by the price tag.</p><p name="1665" id="1665" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, the slugging culture is aligned with the growing awareness of sustainability — by advocating the use of only a single product, slugging can discourage the excessive consumption of skincare products and possibly encourage a more mindful approach to beauty. It is something the world needs right now. And consumers can simplify their routines and minimize waste.</p><p name="1ca3" id="1ca3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But as always, a different approach does not always mean effective — as mentioned earlier, encouraging one product can prevent important products from going mainstream, especially when it is targeted to a specific audience that solely relies on it. Yet, slugging has prompted consumers to evaluate the marketing claims made by beauty brands about using one product. No matter, slugging has truly played a role in empowering consumers to make choices based on their skincare needs, it does not matter what people do if it works for them and their overall mental health.</p></div></div></section><section name="a38c" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="cbf6" id="cbf6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">FOLLOW OUR SOCIALS:</p><p name="9868" id="9868" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/skincare-anarchy/id1522162686</p><p name="6291" id="6291" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spotify Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/298oIu74qjd3pXaaBMDr19</p><p name="57f4" id="57f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/skincareanarchy/?hl=en</p><p name="5759" id="5759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/skincareanarchhy/</p><p name="bcc6" id="bcc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Twitter: https://twitter.com/SkincareAnarchy</p><p name="9170" id="9170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Anarchy/</p><p name="71e0" id="71e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/skincareanarchy/</p><p name="5142" id="5142" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pinterest: https://cz.pinterest.com/skincareanarchy/_created/</p><p name="e6d4" id="e6d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@skincareanarchy</p><p name="51e6" id="51e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Medium Blog:</p><p name="7804" id="7804" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">https://skincareanarchy.medium.com</p></div></div></section>
