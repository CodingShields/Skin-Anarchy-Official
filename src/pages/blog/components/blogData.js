Fragrances were typically extracted from various sources, such as flowers, fruits, resins, and spices, and then infused with oils.</p>
                <p>Oil jars, or alabastrons, were crucial in preserving and transporting these precious oils. Made from alabaster, a type of stone, these containers were designed to be small and easily portable.
